### Why use this camera framework
- High [codebeat GPA](https://codebeat.co/projects/github-com-eonist-hybridcamera-master)
- Low class scoped variable count (In order to better handle overall state)
- Setup errors can be handled from the POV of the initiator
- Operation errors is handled in the onCapture completion block
- Callback based (as oppose to delegate based) [More info](https://medium.cobeisfresh.com/why-you-shouldn-t-use-delegates-in-swift-7ef808a7f16b)
- Easily styleable (The camera view is separate from the UI view)
- No third-party libraries or Sugar
- Entirely programatic (No storyboard)
- Thoroughly documented (Artifacts and sideEffects etc)
- Uses [Sindre-lint style guide](https://github.com/sindresorhus/swiftlint-sindre)
- Small footprint, only ~750 LOC (Lines of code)
### Notes:
- In order to keep things simple, The UI is CGRect based. Use your own Autolayout distro like SnapKit etc when adding additional UI

### Install:
- SPM: `.package(url: "https://github.com/eonist/HybridCamera.git", .branch("master"))`
- Manual: Open `HybridCamera.xcodeproj`

**IMPORTANT:** Make sure info.plist has these variables

   Swift.print("On Video capture complete \(url)")
}
```
